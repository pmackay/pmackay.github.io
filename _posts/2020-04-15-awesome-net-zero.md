I've been a long-time fan of Sindre Sorhus's [awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) as a very useful starting point for learning about a topic. Some time back he [posted an issue](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/issues/732) asking for lists on other topics outside the scope of software development (most lists are broadly related to this). 

Lockdown has presented a useful opportunity to create a list about another great crisis of our time, climate breakdown and how we can solve it by achieving net zero. So I've started [Awesome Net Zero](https://github.com/pmackay/awesome-net-zero) as a list to collate references that are specific to this or closely related to reducing climate change impacts generally.

Do consider adding new entries or contact me to suggest ideas!

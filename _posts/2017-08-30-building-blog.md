To start this blog, here's a quick summary of how I built this blog:

* Created a fork of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), which appealed as a simple and clean framework. The [Lanyon subtheme](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) was very close but rather than use that directly I cherry picked a few simple elements.

* Followed this [setup guide](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/) to get Jekyll updated and setup with GitHub Pages, using my default

* Initially I tried to get LiveReload working using this excellent post, [Setting up LiveReload with Jekyll](http://dan.doezema.com/2014/01/setting-up-livereload-with-jekyll/), but found it problematic to actually get the livereloading working. While digging around to solve that I found [hawkins](https://github.com/awood/hawkins), which is simpler and just seems to work.

* Registered and [setup](https://help.github.com/articles/quick-start-setting-up-a-custom-domain/) a custom domain. I chose a [`www` subdomain](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-www-subdomain/) as it has a few [additional benefits](https://help.github.com/articles/about-supported-custom-domains/#www-subdomains).

I've worked with Jekyll before, notably on experimenting with styleguides, so am keen to use it also for blogging :-)
